    However VSCode provides emmet by default

<!-- Add a h1 tag by pressing h1 & tab key/ enter key-->
<h1>Heading One</h1>
<!-- save it and run open the file in your file explorer 
    if you know the fundamentals of computers 
    then you must know that this file is loaded in memory and then it's servered in the webserver 
-->

<!-- Make sure you have installed the plugin named Live Server-->

<h2>Heading Two</h2>
<!-- 
    What is the real importance of h1 & h2 tag ?  Is it just for making the heading larger or smaller ?

    We can make the h2 tag larger then h1 using CSS but the difference lies in the importnace 
    which means the h1 tag will be given more importance than the h2 tag 
    
    we will see how these tags helps in ranking a website in the browser ðŸ‘‡

<!-- 
    **** Let's understand with better example !! ***

    some website creators use the first technique to declare there address 

    however the second one is more understandable to the browser & it will rank it on top than the first method
