    <h1>Forms in HTML</h1>
<!-- Note: Every element within a form is submitted as a bundle to the backend to process-->

<!-- ****FORM TAG & IT's ATTRIBUTES EXPLANATION**** -->
<!-- action attribute within the <form> tag 
    denotes the location where you want to send the data to 
    i.e, where the data is stored and send for further processing 
    mostly, sent into the backend url(can be javascript, database), we will learn about it later in backend playlist
-->
<!-- There are two types of forms which are denoted my methods:
    1. GET 
    Example: Google search (it is get type form i.e, the data is visible in the url)
    
    2. POST : Used whenever we want to send the data into the server because it encrypts the data(which means data is not sent as clear text format)
-->
<!-- accept-charset refers to what type of text and emoji we allow -->
<!-- autocomplete attribute can either be turned on or off 
    as per requirement of the the form, generally turned off if we are working with sensitive data -->
<!-- enctype attribute stands for encrypt/encoding type
    which generally have 3 more types specified within it 
    *1. application : Default. All characters are encoded before sent (spaces are converted to "+" symbols, and special characters are converted to ASCII HEX values)
    *2. multipart/form-data : This value is necessary if the user will upload a file through the form
    *3. text/plain : Sends data without any encoding at all. Not recommended
    -->


    <form action="url" method="GET" accept-charset="UTF-8", autocomplete="off", enctype="">
        <!-- Input Element  -->
        <label for="fname">First Name</label> <!-- Label Tag -->
        <input type="text" placeholder="first name" name="" id="fname">
        <br>
        <!-- Explanation: 
            1. we use "input:text" inorder to take input from the user, and we can give purpose of the input field in "placeholder". We will later see the importance of "name" & "id" and other attributes in a form. 
            2. we use <label> tag to label our input field 
            why it is important ? 
            screen reader can't read the placeholder which is why we use label tag.
            Now comming to "id" in input element, it is associated with the "for" attribute in <label> tag. 
            When we run this form now we can see whenever we click on the label it will highlight the input element associated with that particular label. 
            3. lastly we use <br> tag to break the line or to switch to next line -->

            <!-- Some more examples  -->
        <label for="lname">Last Name</label>  
        <input type="text" placeholder="last name" name="" id="lname">
        <br>
        <label for="email">Email ID</label>  
        <input type="text" placeholder="email id" name="" id="email">
    </form>
